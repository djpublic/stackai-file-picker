## Technical choices

The video has a good explanation of most features and decisions, but in this file you can find ideas, explanations, hooks list, etc.

### File Picker vs. On-page component

I started the project building a very similar version to what Stack AI has in production, but I believe that took most of my time and I was spending too much time in a way to make the FilePicker re-usable as much as possible, but in the end, due to the need of requesting both Knowledge Basic and the Connection API, I tought it would be a better user experience to have just one.

The only downside with this approach is that it's not super clear to the user which files are included in the sub-folders. But I do think this is something could be improved in the future.

It's important while using the project that you are a User looking at a Knowledge Base with the Google Drive connection active for you. That's the whole context of the approach I took. I am not creating more Knowledge Bases, and I avoided hitting the Knowledge Bases list endpoint, because I tested online and it's really slow.

I stick with the `688e4996-da83-45ee-8ed5-a8c8daaf0308` Knowledge base as the context for the application.

### Stack

I followed the suggested stack from the project, including Zustand.

- Plus: I added JEST for tests
- Plus: I added Github Actions in the CI
- Plus: I generated a Postman collection from the Jupyter file, it was very using during development

### Bonus Features

I did not have time to implement the filters and sorting, but I added the search. I found the search endpoints by using the Stack API production app. There's no search API in the Jupyter file.

### Known Issues

- Checkboxes when selecting parent/children needs some improvements;
- Some inconsistency with some React Query invalidations: Because I always need two API's to sync the files indexed, I had some challenges to invalidate the queries;
- The API authentication method: I did not implement a cookie-based authentication, so for the purpose of this code challenge, all requests are making a new authentication in the BACKEND;

### Usage of Hooks

This project makes extensive use of custom React hooks to encapsulate logic for data fetching, mutations, and state management. Using hooks in this way keeps the codebase modular, readable, and easy to maintain. Each hook is focused on a single responsibility, which makes testing and reusing logic much simpler.

**Pros of the hook approach:**

- **Separation of concerns:** Each hook handles a specific piece of logic, keeping components clean and focused on UI.
- **Reusability:** Hooks can be reused across different components, reducing code duplication.
- **Consistency:** Data fetching, mutations, and side effects are handled in a consistent way throughout the app.

**Key hooks in this project:**

- `useFetchResources`: Fetches files and folders from either the knowledge base or the connection (e.g., Google Drive) for a given path. Handles loading and error states.
- `useDeleteKnowledgeBaseResource`: Handles the mutation to de-index (remove) a file or folder from the knowledge base, including error handling and UI feedback.
- `useKnowledgeBaseStore`: Manages global state related to the current knowledge base, such as the selected knowledge base and its properties.
- `useFileTreeStore`: Manages the state of the file tree, including selected files, expanded folders, syncing items, and search/filter state.
- `useProcessSync` (in `hooks/sync/use-process-sync.ts`): Orchestrates the multi-step process of syncing files to the knowledge base, including updating resources and triggering the sync process.
- `useSmartSelection`: Handles complex selection logic for files and folders, including parent/child relationships, bulk selection, and smart directory selection behavior.
- `useCheckOnFirstRender`: Automatically checks items on first render based on their checked state or parent's checked state.
- `usePutKnowledgeBase`: Mutation hook to update a knowledge base with new resource IDs.
- `usePutKnowledgeBaseSync`: Mutation hook to trigger the sync process for a knowledge base.
- `poolKbSyncPendingResources`: Utility hook/function to refresh or poll the state of pending resources being synced, ensuring the UI stays up-to-date.

Overall, the use of hooks in this project leads to a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase. Each hook is well-scoped and documented, making it easy for new developers to understand and extend the functionality.

### The FileTree Components

The `components/file-tree` directory contains the main logic and UI for browsing, selecting, and managing files and folders from both the knowledge base and the connected source (e.g., Google Drive). The core challenge addressed here is to present a unified file tree that merges data from two different APIs:

- **Knowledge Base API**: Represents files and folders that have already been indexed (synced) into the application's knowledge base.
- **Connection API**: Represents the live file structure from the external source (such as Google Drive), including files and folders that may not yet be indexed.

#### How the APIs Interact

When rendering the file tree, the app needs to show both:

- Which files/folders exist in the external source (connection API).
- Which of those are already indexed in the knowledge base (knowledge base API).

To achieve this, the `FileTreeRow` component fetches data from both APIs for each folder level:

- It calls the knowledge base API to get the list of indexed resources for the current path.
- It calls the connection API to get the live list of files/folders for the same path.

The utility function `enhanceItems` then merges these two lists, marking which items are already indexed and which are not. This allows the UI to show, for example, which files are "synced" and which are only present in the external source.

#### FileTree Component Structure

- **FileTree**: The root component. It manages the overall table and selection state.
- **FileTreeRow**: Recursively renders each folder and its children. For each folder, it fetches and merges data from both APIs.
- **FileTreeItem**: Renders a single file or folder row, including actions like delete (de-index) and selection.
- **FileTreeItemDelete**: Handles the logic for de-indexing a file from the knowledge base, using a confirmation dialog and mutation hook.

#### Key Solution Points

- **Merging Data**: The main technical solution is to merge the two data sources at each folder level, so the UI can accurately reflect both the live file structure and the indexed state.
- **State Management**: Zustand is used to manage selection, expansion, and syncing state across the file tree.
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks encapsulate the logic for fetching, mutating, and syncing data, keeping components clean and focused.

#### Recommendations for Improvement

- **Pagination and Performance**: Add pagination or lazy loading for folders with many files to improve performance and usability.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Implement more advanced sorting and filtering options in the file tree UI.

### UI Decisions

### The Checkbox handler (Smart selection)

One of the most complex features in this project is the file tree selection system. Instead of using a pure state management approach, I implemented a **hybrid solution** that combines **Zustand store** with **DOM manipulation** to handle the hierarchical selection logic efficiently.

#### **Hybrid Approach: Zustand + DOM Manipulation**

**How it works:**

- **Zustand Store** (`useFileTreeStore`): Manages the final list of `selectedItems` and provides core selection methods (`toggleSelected`, `selectAll`)
- **DOM Manipulation** (`useSmartSelection`): Uses `document.querySelector` to traverse the DOM tree and find parent-child relationships via `data-id`, `data-parent-id`, and `data-level` attributes

**Key Functions:**

- `getDirectoryDescendants()`: Recursively finds all child elements in the DOM tree using CSS selectors
- `getElementLevel()`: Reads the `data-level` attribute from DOM elements to determine hierarchy depth
- `handleDirectorySelection()`: When a folder is selected, it automatically finds and selects all descendants via DOM traversal

#### **Pros of this Approach:**

1. **Performance**: Avoids massive re-renders that would occur if I tracked the entire tree structure in React state
2. **Memory Efficiency**: No need to duplicate the tree structure in memory - the DOM already contains it
3. **Simplicity**: Leverages the existing DOM structure instead of building complex nested state objects
4. **Real-time**: Always works with the current DOM state, even as the tree expands/collapses dynamically

#### **Cons of this Approach:**

1. **Tight Coupling**: Logic is tightly coupled to the DOM structure and CSS selectors
2. **Testing Complexity**: Harder to unit test since it requires a DOM environment
3. **Fragility**: Could break if DOM structure or data attributes change
4. **Less Predictable**: DOM queries can be less predictable than pure state management

#### **Smart Selection Behaviors:**

**1. Selecting All (Directory Selection):**

```typescript
// When a directory is checked, automatically select all descendants
const descendants = getDirectoryDescendants(currentElement);
const allIds = [id, ...descendants];
selectAll(items, checkedState);
```

**2. Child Selection vs. Unchecking Parent:**

- When a child is **unchecked**, it automatically unchecks its parent if the parent was previously checked
- Uses DOM traversal to find the parent element and updates its state
- Prevents inconsistent states where a parent appears selected but has unselected children

**3. Parent with All Selected:**

- When all children of a directory are individually selected, the parent automatically appears checked
- This is handled through the `allSelectedDefault` state and visual feedback

#### **Avoiding Backend Duplication with `cleanupSelectedItems`**

A critical optimization in my sync process is the `cleanupSelectedItems` utility function:

```typescript
export const cleanupSelectedItems = (
  selectedItems: { id: string; parentId: string | undefined }[]
): string[] => {
  // Remove child items when parent is also selected
  // This avoids duplicate work on the backend
};
```

**Why this matters:** Without this cleanup, selecting both a folder and its individual files would cause the backend to process the same files twice - once as part of the folder and once as individual resources. As mentioned in the requirements: _"While the backend will work fine and index everything under test_folder, there will be duplicate work to get the metadata of the Contrato_pagos_inmediatos.pdf file both as a child of test_folder and as an independent resource."_

The cleanup function ensures I only send parent directories to the backend when both parent and children are selected, eliminating this redundant processing and improving sync performance.

### API Routes

I decided to hit the API fully from the backend. I tried to follw as much as I could the REST approach, but some APIs are not following exactly REST. They are all located in `/app/api`.

#### API Routes in `/app/api`

Below are the main API routes used in this project, described in a human-friendly way:

- **Knowledge Base Resources**

  - `GET /api/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}/resources?resource_path=...`
    - Fetches resources (files/folders) for a given knowledge base at a specific path.
  - `PUT /api/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}`
    - Updates the knowledge base with new resource IDs (used for syncing files).
  - `GET /api/knowledge_bases/sync/trigger/{knowledgeBaseId}`
    - Triggers the sync process for a knowledge base.

- **Connection Resources**

  - `GET /api/connections/{connectionId}?resource_id=...&search=...`
    - Fetches resources (files/folders) from a connected source (e.g., Google Drive) at a specific path, with optional search.

- **Resource Deletion**

  - `DELETE /api/knowledge-bases/{knowledgeBaseId}/resources`
    - De-indexes (removes) a file or folder from the knowledge base (does not delete from Google Drive).

- **Other**
  - There may be additional endpoints for authentication, user info, or other features, but the above are the core file and sync-related routes.

**Note:**

- All routes are RESTful and return JSON.
- Most routes require a valid `knowledgeBaseId` or `connectionId`.
- The sync process is multi-step and involves both updating and triggering sync on the knowledge base.

If you need more details on a specific route, check the corresponding handler in `/app/api`.

### The Sync files Process

By learning from the Stack AI production app, I realized that the way the project index files into the database is very unusual. I created a big hook (hooks/sync/use-process-sync.ts) that executes the sync in different steps, and at the end invalidate the queries.

This is how the sync process works:

1. Show a toast notification to inform the user that sync is starting.
2. Optimistically update the UI to reflect that selected items are being indexed.
3. Collapse all expanded file paths to reload the root directory (like Stack AI app behavior).
4. Send a PUT request to /knowledge-base/{id} to update the knowledge base with the selected resource IDs.
5. Trigger the sync process by calling GET /knowledge_bases/sync/trigger/{id}.
6. Invalidate queries so the UI can refetch

## Usage of AI

The challenge don't mention if it's allowed to use AI or not. I think it's important to mention how it was used in this project.

- To setup jest environment
- To help me with some questions here and there
- To understand some ideas I had in mind.
- To write some boring parts of the README

Overall, I avoided using AI to code, because the code quality is REALLY REALLY bad with new projects with proper project rules, etc, based on my past experiences. Code quality is good with AI when you have a well-defined project.

You can ask me more about AI usage during an interview.

## Overall Comment

I had some hard time to focus and do everything I wanted for this project. I do think I am a great fit for the Stack AI team, and I can show more of my work if you need extra meetings, system design meetings, etc.

The codebase is organized, and it's spread into smaller components, but like I said in the known-issues, there are room for improvement, as everything in life :).
