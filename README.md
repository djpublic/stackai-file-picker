## ¬†UI/UX quality:

- Does everything work as expected? Are there any console errors or broken features?
  A: I believe what was requested is implemented. Console errors are empty. Broken features, should be ok.

- Is it fast? Do you have to wait for the UI? Does it make good use of optimistic updates? Do you rollback on errors?
  A: The API is slow for some operations, but it's using some UI/Skeleton techniques that helps with the user experience.

- Is it intuitive?
  A: I believe so.

- Does it look visually appealing?
  A: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

- Low Cumulative Layout Shift? Do things move around when clicking something (this is bad)?
  A: I tried to have little CLS, but with the time I had, I think the UX is good.
